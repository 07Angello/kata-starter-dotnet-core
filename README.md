# Welcome to the Kata Starter for .NET Core

## Job Candidates

Your pair interview will be conducted in .NET Core and C#. If you're not experienced with C#, no worries. This interview will not judge your ability in one language or technology, but how you manage yourself in a situation with new concepts and techniques. Even C# veterans will be challenged by this interview, so everyone will be on a level playing field!

### Prepare Your Machine

1) Install the latest version of Jetbrains Rider (free evaluation).

2) Install Dotnet SDK 2.2 or higher

3) In Rider, install the plugin "Machine Specifications Runner for Rider" (File > Settings > Plugins)

4) Fork this repo, add your interviewer's github account as a collaborator, and send the link to your forked repo.

5) Make sure everything compiles and the unit tests run.
